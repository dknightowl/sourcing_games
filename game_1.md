I met James Jones a few years ago, and he helped me with some things at recruitment.camp. To speed up our communication, I gave him an email at recruitment.camp.

However, I had to learn how to create a professional email address, especially since James didn’t want to have a dot in the email address.

His email is the password to the file below ([Download file](https://sourcing.games/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/james.docx)).

Hint: Don’t let bounce, disposable, spam-trap and deactivated emails decrease your sending reputation.

**Note:** _Do not contact James or the owner (me) of recruitment.camp via email or contact form on the site!  Be a sourcer, the **hint is enough.** Spamming will get your IP blocked._

## Solution:

1. Find professional email convention
2. Find typical work email at recruitment.camp via terms of service (e.g. support@recruitment.camp)
3. Trial and error: jamesj@recruitment.camp
4. Password is `sourcingfun`
