**THINK LOCALLY, ACT LOCALLY!**

In 2016, I met a great guy, who worked as a Developer in Poland, not sure if he was from Warsaw, Wroclaw or Crakow. But what I remember was that he is a developer (intermediate level), working with Angular, Java, JUnit and Python.

When he told me his name I thought that he was a foreigner, but he doesn’t speak a word in English, only Polish.  
I also found his LinkedIn profile, I hope he will learn English and I wish I was fluent in Polish.

You can use his name as a password for another level. (Lower case letters only)

Example: john-doe  (first name-surname)

## Solution:
1. Google "intermediate developer angular java junit python poland site:pl.linkedin.com"
2. Look for non-English result(s)
3. ![img6.1](/images/20250819162753.png)
4. Password: `petr-davis`
